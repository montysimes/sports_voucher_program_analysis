NOTE: The project contains segments of code that populate interactive maps using the folium library. These segments were not run in the file that was uploaded to GitHub to reduce file size. The repository will need to be cloned to access the interactive maps. The insights commented on were gained from investigating these interactive maps. 
The files folder contain additional geographic data to assist with geographic plotting. The original source of this data can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-b71223e0-2235-4973-90e9-d279687b7ef8/details)
